# Cat-Image-Recognizer
This project will try to prove that Neural Network (Deep Learning) works better that a classic Machine Learning Algorithm.
# Part 1 (Logistic Regression)
In the first part I used Logistic Regression (a Classic Machine learning algorithm) to classify images as cat(=1) or non-cat(=0).
The results were as follows:

**The algorithm predicted with an accuracy of 70%.**
