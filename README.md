# Cat-Image-Recognizer
This project will try to prove that a Neural Network (Deep Learning) works better than a classical Machine Learning Algorithm by using both of them in a single classification problem.
# Part 1 (Logistic Regression)
In the first part I used Logistic Regression (a Classic Machine learning algorithm) to classify images as cat(=1) or non-cat(=0).        
The results were as follows:

**The algorithm predicted with an accuracy of 70%.**

# Part 2 (Shallow Neural Network)
For the second part I used a Shallow Neural Network which means it has two layers and one of them is a hidden layer.            
The results were as follows:

**The algorithm predicted with an accuracy of 72%.** 

# Part 3 (Deep Neural Network)
For the third and last part I used a Deep Neural Network having four layers with three of them being hidden layers.                      
The results were as follows:

**The algorithm predicted with an accuracy of 80%.**
